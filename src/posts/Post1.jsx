      <h1>Training Philosophy</h1>
      <p>Training should be viewed as a lifelong endeavor. It enables individuals to maintain a desirable quality of life as they age—not only through physical fitness but also through cognitive benefits. Since training is something to be sustained over the long term, the main concerns should be sustainability and consistency. There are no shortcuts or secrets to adding weight to your bench or attaining the benefits of training. Adaptations occur slowly over time through consistent effort.
Enjoyment is a major consideration in training. It is not sustainable for someone who dreads lifting weights to continue simply because they feel they should. Each person should seek out whatever form of strength and endurance training they find enjoyable and that they can consistently maintain over the years to make progress in those areas.
Optimization can easily overtake decision-making when choosing how to split up training days and select exercises, but it shouldn't be the primary factor. If someone finds themselves drawn to that training style, that’s great—but obsessing over the exact number of sets per muscle per week, reps in reserve for each set, or the precise angle of an exercise to perfectly align with muscle fibers is a case of paralysis by analysis. There is no one-size-fits-all training style, weekly volume, or exercise selection for everyone. The only universal key to training is to train hard and consistently. That means each person must discover what they personally enjoy and what works best for them—and train that way, with intensity.
Self-experimentation is important in this process because it allows individuals to determine what they enjoy doing and how they have responded—positively or negatively—in the past. Taking one person’s anecdote from a YouTube Short as fact and assuming it will apply the same to everyone is silly. Try it for yourself first and come to your own conclusion. Slowly, over time, you’ll build your own stack of evidence to pull from—based on how things have worked for you—which allows you to make better, individualized decisions rooted in personal data, not advice from some clown on the internet.
Strength is the foundation of all aspects of physical ability. It is the building block of athleticism, muscle development, and longevity. That’s why the majority of my training revolves around developing and maintaining strength. The general makeup of my workout is 80/20 strength to hypertrophy. Strength work is performed at a weight between 60–90% of my one-rep max, for a rep range that is 30–70% of the maximum number of reps I can do with that weight. These sets are not taken to failure, as the goal is not to build muscle but to develop strength. Strength adaptations are achieved through many repetitions of moderately heavy weight for a moderate number of reps. Rest periods for strength work are longer—typically 4 to 6 minutes between sets of an exercise. Training antagonist muscle groups and alternating between movements is a great way to break up the long rest times and be more time efficient. For example: push exercise, rest 3 minutes; pull exercise, rest 3 minutes; repeat.
Exercise selection for these strength movements focuses on compound exercises that take the muscles through a large range of motion and can be easily progressed by adding weight. Movements are selected based on four different movement patterns to ensure the entire body is trained. These four movement patterns are: push, pull, squat, and hinge. The list of exercises I use for these movement patterns is as follows:
•	Push – barbell or dumbbell flat, incline, or overhead press, and dips
•	Pull – Pull-ups, barbell or dumbbell rows
•	Squat – Back, front, and zercher squat
•	Hinge – Deadlift and Romanian deadlift
Plyometrics are incorporated during the warm-up. It’s important to get properly warmed up to handle the heavy loads involved in strength work. Plyometrics help activate the central nervous system by moving light loads at high speeds. They also help improve and maintain athleticism. Here are some examples of plyometrics I use to warm up for upper and lower body days:
•	Upper – push-ups, banded pull-ups, dumbbell rows
•	Lower – vertical, broad, and lateral jumps, kettlebell swings, and sprints
Hypertrophy work comes after strength training in each workout and typically consists of 1–3 sets of 8–15 reps, taken to failure or close to it. Exercise selection is based on whatever you want to focus on or simply enjoy doing. I believe it is important to train through multiple rep ranges but, the primary focus of the workout is strength—building muscle is more of a byproduct than the goal.
Endurance training is mostly performed in Zone 2 for a duration of 30–60 minutes. The goal is not high intensity, but rather to build a solid foundation of aerobic capacity that can be developed further over time. This can include running or a high incline walk, while staying within the desired heart rate zone to accumulate volume and effectively train the cardiovascular system.
